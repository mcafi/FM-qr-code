# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Introduction

I just found about this site, [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) with lots of frontend challenges.

## QR code component

The preview can be found on the [GitHub page](https://mcafi.github.io/FM-qr-code) of this repository.

## Technologies

I am a huge fan of **Tailwind CSS** but I thought that challenges like challenges would be a valuable tool for sharpening my skills with the basics.

Using a frontend and/or CSS framework for a challenge like this would have been an overkill, so i decided to oly use plain HTML and CSS. This was also an opportunity to use CSS variables, which I haven't used very often before.
